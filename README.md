# TCS_supervisor
A python class to represent and execute a supervisor synthesized by Ramadgeâ€“Wonham Supervisor Control Theory (TCS)

It was designed to be able to generate automata from xml files generated by Supremica software. 

#Building handlers
First we need to creat the events and states handlers. For that, use:
```
from lib.Automaton import Automaton

G1 = Automaton('name')
G1.read_xml('Supremica_file.xml')
```

With the Automanton created, it is possible to automatically generate the handlers for the execution EVENTS and STATES:
```
G1.gen_events_calls()	
G1.gen_states_calls()
```

It will create a new directory where you will be able to implement the execution code related to each event and state of the automata.

The 'Generator.py' file show an example of Automaton creation.


#Running the State Machine
In another file, after the handlers have been created, use the same Automaton to start the State Machine execution by the following code:
```
from lib.Automaton import Automaton
from lib.StateMachine import StateMachine
from handlers.EVENTS import *

G1 = Automaton('name')
G1.read_xml('Supremica_file.xml')
SM = StateMachine(G1)
SM.start()
```

By now, the State Machine is running and always that an event occur it will be updated and events will be enabled or disabled as required.
To trigger an event use:
```
event_name.call()
```
